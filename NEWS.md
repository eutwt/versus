# versus (development version)

* The `compare()` function now saves a shallow copy of the input tables. This
  means functions using a comparison, e.g. `slice_diffs()`, now only need the
  `comparison` argument, rather than requiring the original input tables to be
  re-supplied.

* New functions `weave_diffs_wide()` an `weave_diffs_long()` are added, which show
  the differing values in context with other columns from the input tables. 

* A new function `slice_unmatched()` is added, used to get the rows from
  input tables a comparison shows as not existing in the other table

# versus 0.2.1

* Patch to avoid error when input is data.table

# versus 0.2.0

* A new function `slice_diffs_both()` is added, used to get the differences from
  both input tables in a single output with the rows interleaved

* The error message for duplicated `by` values now shows the row which is duplicated

* Comparisons are now faster

# versus 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
